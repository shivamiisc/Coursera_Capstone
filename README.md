# Coursera_Capstone
datascience capstone project
In this project, we have gone through the process of identifying the business 
problem, specifying the data required, extracting and preparing the data, performing 
machine learning by clustering the data into 3 clusters based on their similarities, 
and lastly providing recommendations to the relevant stakeholders i.e. property 
developers and investors regarding the best locations to open a new Restaurant. 



To answer the business question that was raised in the introduction section, the 
answer proposed by this project is: The neighbourhoods in cluster 1 are the most 
preferred locations to open a new Restaurant. The findings of this project will 
help the relevant stakeholders to capitalize on the opportunities on high potential 
locations while avoiding overcrowded areas in their decisions to open a new 
shopping mall.
